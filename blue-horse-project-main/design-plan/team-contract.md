# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    1. Tiffany Q. will submit all milestones and the final submission. She will also send the submission confirmation email to all the group members after.
    2. Everyone has to contribute to both the design journey and coding on time.
    3. Everyone should keep themselves accountable and fulfill all their necessary responsibilities.
    4. The individual with the client connect will meet with the client at least 2 times for every milestone: at the start of every milestone to identify what we need to do and right before submission to make sure we did everything to their standards and goals.
    5. One person is responsible for drawing and uploading all physical sketches, however, all group member will discuss and agree upon the sketch designs and planning before it is uploaded.
    6. If there is a conflict in design ideas/coding, we communicate our issues with the group members first bofore taking any action.

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.
    1. One mic for meetings (one person speaks at a time; the others should listen attentively).
    2. Before we start any work, we'll identify what we'll do in our groupchat, that way, we'll have less merge conflicts.
    3. Respect everybody's opinions/ideas.


3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?
   1. We'll meet at least once a week to discuss our progress on the project (typically Sat or Sun).
   2. We will also meet whenever time permits during our lab sections in person.
   3. We'll also try to meet quickly right before each milestone submission to finalize and double-check everything.


4. How will we communicate and work with our client?
    1. For our initial meeting, everyone in our group will meet with the client so we can discuss their overall goals and plans for the website and conduct an interview as a group to get to know our client.
    2. After this, there will be one team member responsible for maintaining communication with the client- most likely the one with the client connect.
    3. As previously mentioned, they'll meet with the client twice: at the start of every milestone and right before milestone submission to make sure that the website is aligned with their vision/goals.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.
    1. Submitter, responsible for the submission forms and submitting the correct commit: Tiffany Q.
    2. Time keeper, responsible for coordinating meetings and providing the links to Zoom meetings: Lena P.
    3. Editior, responsible for looking over and validating all work before submission: Tiffany Q.
    4. Client Connect, responsible for maintaining contact with the client through updates about their goals and the site's progress: Ruth C.P.
    5. Sketcher, reponsible for drawing and uploading all sketches: Winifred
    6. Project Manager, staying on track towards the milestone and final submission, as well as, keeping tracking of each team member contributions: Thomas D.

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?
    1. The project manager will keep track of what's getting done and make sure that everything is progressing.
       1. If a team member is falling behind or not completing their assigned works, the project manager would reach out to the lacking team member in private first and assess the situation and remind them of their responsibilities
    2. As a group, we can send reminders in the groupchat throughout the milestone to make sure we know to get our work done on time.
    3. If a group member cannot get anything done on time due to some conflict (prelim, emergency, etc.), they should notify the group (in advance if possible) so the project manager can re-assign their work.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict do we all agree to uphold?
    1. Conflict between members: the project manager will handle all mediation
       1. All members should try to avoid conflict by listening and being respectful towards one another
       2. If the project manager cannot solve the issue, we'll talk with the professor
    2. Conflict between the client and the group: the client connect will handle those issues and update the group on the situation.
    3. External conflicts: Members, will inform each other in the groupchat in advance (if possible) if they have any conflicts that will interfere with the completion of their work.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?
    1. If we're facing many too many conflicts (decided by the project manager), we will revisit the contract as a group.
    2. If we are struggling to finish by deadlines, we will revisit to remind ourselves of our responsibilities and how we will keep ourselves accountable.
    3. If one member is lacking, we can use the contract as a reminder to our promise as a team to contribute equally.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!
    1. Have fun
    2. After the project is completed, we can have a celebratory team dinner.

10. Group Members should complete their parts by latest Wednesday 12:00pm (mid-day). We will aim to submit by 5:00 pm.


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
