      <p>
        Based at Cornell University, Seline's: The Experience strive to bring the taste of home to Ithaca. The Experience began with a simple passion for bringing people together through the joy of home-cooked meals, especially for those that are far from home and are tired of the same, nonchanging restaurant dishes or dining hall meals. What started as just creating small dishes in dorm rooms for friends at Cornell University quickly evolved into a larger pop-up business.
      </p>

      <p>
        The name “Seline’s” comes from my middle name Seline. It is not a name most people know me as or what I go by but my mom always said Delesa Seline together when I was kid. When I was thinking about names for my business I wanted it to be unique but still tied to me. That is what I feel Seline is… unique and personally tied to myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Initially, I was going to use my grandma’s name, Jonell, but decided against that because I wanted to save that for something really big like my first brick-and-mortar restaurant. Speaking of which, when I talk about things that inspired me to create Seline’s it begins with her… my grandma.
      </p>

      <p>
        She is the reason why I do most things in my field of study which is Hospitality Management with a specific focus on Food and Beverage. She was the first person to ever get me in the kitchen and was the first person to give me a recipe book and she hand-wrote my first recipe in it. My grandma’s biggest aspiration was to own her own restaurant. Unfortunately, she became too sick to fulfill this dream.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, just two mere years after her passing I intend to carry out a dream that became for the both of us. Seline’s is not that standing alone but I refer to it as Selines: The Experience because to me, food is an experience and a story told only through the journey of one's tastebuds. I like to say I bring the taste of “home” to Ithaca. That taste of home is the taste of my grandma’s kitchen and everything I have learned and adapted into my own over the years.
      </p>

      <p>
        People often ask me “What do you like to make?” which I always like to follow up with “Whatever you like to eat!” This is because I love to continue to challenge myself with different cuisines and things to put my own spin on. Overall, my hope for Seline’s is for this to just be the beginning of a fulfilled, prosperous, and generational wealth-generating future. And the crazy part of it all… is that it all started in a dorm room with nothing but a suggestion and a dream!
